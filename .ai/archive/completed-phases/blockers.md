## DuckDB Native Module Build Issue

### Problem
When trying to run migrations, getting error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '.../duckdb/lib/binding/duckdb.node'
```

### Context
- Using waddler package which depends on native duckdb module
- pnpm is not automatically building the native module
- Even after `pnpm rebuild duckdb`, the module is not found

### Potential Solutions
1. Use `pnpm approve-builds` to allow duckdb build scripts
2. Manually run node-gyp to build the native module
3. Switch to @duckdb/duckdb-wasm (WebAssembly version) instead
4. Use a different database approach

### Impact
- Cannot run migrations
- Cannot proceed with GraphQL server implementation
- Blocking Phase 1 completion

### Decision Needed
Need to decide whether to:
- Continue troubleshooting native duckdb build
- Switch to WebAssembly version
- Use a different database solution
