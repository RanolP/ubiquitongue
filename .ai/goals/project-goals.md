# Ubiquitongue Project Goals

## Primary Goal
Create a comprehensive, searchable database of mathematical and computer science notations that maps syntaxes to their semantic meanings, helping researchers disambiguate notational conflicts.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Bidirectional Index ✅
- **Notation Search**: Look up any mathematical notation to find its meaning and usage
- **Unified Model**: Each notation contains both semantic meaning and syntactic forms
- **Paper Links**: Each notation linked to papers where it's used with context

### 2. Community-Driven Resource
- Enable researchers to contribute new notations
- Provide discussion mechanisms for ambiguous cases
- Track usage statistics and popularity

### 3. Technical Excellence ✅
- **Fast Search**: FlexSearch with <50ms response time
- **Smart Parser**: Can parse mathematical notation (e.g., "a ∪ b", "sum i=1 to n")
- **Math Rendering**: Beautiful Typst rendering with typst.ts
- **Static Site**: Astro-powered, deployed on GitHub Pages

## Target Outcomes

### For Researchers
- Reduce time spent deciphering unfamiliar notations
- Find conventional notations for their papers
- Discover alternative notations used in different fields

### For Students
- Understand notations encountered in academic papers
- Learn standard ways to express mathematical concepts
- Bridge notation gaps between different courses/texts

### For the Community
- Establish notation conventions through usage data
- Reduce ambiguity in academic communication
- Create a living reference that evolves with the field

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage**: 100+ fundamental notations in Math/CS/PLT
2. **Performance**: <100ms search response time
3. **Usability**: Intuitive interface requiring no manual
4. **Community**: Active contributions and issue discussions
5. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime via static hosting

## Long-term Vision

Become the de facto standard reference for academic notation, eventually expanding beyond Math/CS to other notation-heavy fields like Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering.
