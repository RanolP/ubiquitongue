# Ubiquitongue AI Knowledge Base

This is Claude's second brain for the Ubiquitongue project. All important decisions, state, and plans are documented here.

## Directory Structure

- **goals/** - Project mission and core objectives
  - `project-description.md` - What Ubiquitongue is and why it exists
  
- **plans/** - Future development roadmap
  - `future-roadmap.md` - Short/medium/long-term feature plans
  
- **state/** - Current project status
  - `current-state-2025-06-24.md` - Latest project state and completed features
  
- **archive/** - Completed items (for reference only)
  - `completed-phases/` - Old state files and completed plans

## Key Principles

1. **Keep it updated** - This is the source of truth for project memory
2. **Archive completed items** - Move done work to archive to reduce clutter
3. **Use YAML frontmatter** - Every file has metadata for tracking
4. **Simple structure** - Easy to navigate and understand

## Current Status

- Project is **LIVE** at https://ubqt.ranolp.dev
- All 5 initial phases completed
- Ready for community contributions and feature expansion
